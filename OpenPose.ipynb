        "\n",
        "Quantitative motion analysis is important for the diagnostics of movement disorders and for research. State-of-the-art measurements involve optical motion capture using reflective markers and expensive cameras to capture trajectories of these markers. Though the technique provides high frequency data for assessment, the cost, skills, and time involved limit wide adoption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent advancements in deep learning allow us to very robustly detect body landmarks (such as toes, hips, shoulders, etc.) in images from commodity cameras, such as found in smartphones. We can apply these techniques to videos to derive trajectories of landmarks in time. Recent studies show that these trajectories can be used for some clinical applications, potentially reducing the cost of movement analyses by orders of magnitude and facilitating more frequent assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Tutorial Overview\n",
        "**In this notebook we illustrate how to use one deep learning algorithm to analyze human motion. Specifically, we will extract knee flexion curves and gait cycles from a video of a subject walking.** The notebook is for illustrative purposes only, and multiple improvements should be incorporated to obtain accurate knee flexion angles. However, the notebook does provide a pipeline that you can adapt to get started with video-based pose estimation projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is a part of the [Mobilize Center](https://mobilize.stanford.edu) webinar series, and is jointly offered with the [Restore Center](https://restore.stanford.edu). The Mobilize Center is an NIH-funded Biomedical Technology Resource Center which provides tools and training to help researchers produce insights from wearables, video, medical images, and other data sources. The Restore Center is an NIH Medical Rehabilitation Research Resource Network Center which is creating a worldwide collaboration to advance the use of real-world data in rehabilitation outcomes for those with movement impairments.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Background and Citation\n",

If you are new to Colab, you can learn about the key features in [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). For the purposes of our tutorial, you only need to understand how to interact with the \"code cells.\" In the [webinar recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js0uRTLfm6s&t=4s), we also provide a quick overview of how to work with this Colab notebook."

As a result, each pose has exactly the same normalized femur length, and the other segments have a length defined relative to the femur length. The length for each segment should be fairly constant from frame to frame, since they have a relatively fixed proportion to the femur in each frame. We chose the femur as it's relatively long, and therefore its measurement is more robust to noise."
